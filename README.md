  * The Seventh Canadian Edition continues the tradition of excellence that has earned Fundamentals of Corporate Finance its status as market leader. Every chapter has been updated to provide the most current examples that reflect Corporate Finance in today's world. This best-selling text is written with one strongly held principle: that corporate finance should be developed and taught in terms of a few integrated, powerful ideas. As such, there are three basic themes that are the central focus of the book:
  * 1) An emphasis on intuition - Underlying ideas are discussed in general terms and then by way of examples that illustrate in more concrete terms how a financial manager might proceed in a given situation.
    2) 2) A unified valuation approach - Net Present Value is treated as the basic concept underlying corporate finance. Every subject covered is firmly rooted in valuation, and care is taken to explain how particular decisions have valuation effects.
       3) 3) A managerial focus - Ross Fundamentals of Corporate Finance emphasizes the role of the financial manager as decision maker, and stresses the need for managerial input and judgement.
